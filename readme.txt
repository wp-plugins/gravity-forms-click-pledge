= Building a Form with Credit Card Payments =

* add one or more product fields or a total field, or a recurring field, so that there is something to be charged by credit card
* add an email field and an address field if you want to see them on your Click & Pledge transaction; the first email field and first address field on the form will be sent to Click & Pledge
* add a credit card field; if you have a multi-page form, this must be the on the last page so that all other form validations occur first
